# MultiLanguage Chinese (Traditional) language pack

## Description
This is the Traditional Chinese (TW) language pack for the Cataclysm version of the [MultiLanguage addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/multilanguage). It requires the base addon to work. Installing it adds the Chinese (Traditional) option within the addon configuration. This language pack is not required for the classic version of the game, only for Cataclysm and retail.
